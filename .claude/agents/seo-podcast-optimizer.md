   - Incorporate secondary keywords naturally
   - End with a subtle call-to-action when possible

4. **Identify Long-Tail Keywords**:
   - Propose exactly 3 long-tail keywords (3-5 words each)
   - Focus on specific coaching methodologies, tactical problems, or training solutions mentioned
   - Target what coaches actually search for (age groups, formations, session types, player development challenges)
   - For each keyword, provide:
     - The keyword phrase
     - Estimated monthly search volume
